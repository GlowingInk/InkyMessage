# Inky Message
Adventure API component serializer inspired by [MineDown](https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown/tree/kyori-adventure). 
An early attempt to make legacy-friendly serializer with modern features.

## TODO
- Fix colors
- Gradient stuff
- Placeholders (for keys, translations, selectors(?))
- Actually implement serializer (as all we have now is deserializer lol)
